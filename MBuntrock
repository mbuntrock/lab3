Part A) Open the diamonds dataset. (9 points total)
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
```
1a. Create a stem and leaf plot to display information about the size of the diamond (carat) (1)
```{r}
stem(diamonds$carat)
```
1b. Is this an effective display of the data? Why or why not? (1)
```{r}
#no this is not an effective display because the data is so large it is not helpful in efficiently explaining the data. Also, i dion't think stem and leaf plots are not very intuitve so they layman would have trouble underserstanding what it means#
```

2a. Create a histogram of the carat column in the diamonds dataset. (1)
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .05)

```
2b. Describe the distribution (1)
#the distribution is positively skewed
2c. Is this an effective display of the data? Why or why not? (1)
#i feel like this histogram is a pretty effective display of the data because it tells you how many in the data set have 'x' amount of carats. It wouldnt be good to make claims but as a researcher and the lay-person these are easy to understand and get a general idea.
```
3a. Make a scatter plot of price by carat (1)
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, carat)) +geom_point()

```
3b. What type of relationship probably exists between these two variables? (1)
#positive relationship
```

4. Make a new scatterplot of price by carat, grouped according to cut (2)
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price, carat)) +geom_point()+facet_wrap(~cut)

```
Part B) Open the ChickWeight dataset (11 pts total)
```{r}
data("ChickWeight")
```
1a. Create a box plot comparing weights of chicks in each diet (1)
```{r}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Diet, y= weight))+geom_boxplot()
```

1b. Broadly, what does this graph show us? (1)
#this graph shows us the 'spread' of the data in each diet. In each diet the boxplot shows the 25th %tile, 75th%tile, outliers, upper and lower adjacent values, and the median
3c. Are there any outliers? If so, where? (1)
#yes there are 4 outliers in diet 1 and 2 outliers in diet 2
```

2. Create a histogram that displays also both weight and diet (hint: use fill to graph the discrete variable) (3)
```{r}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Diet, y=weight))+geom_histogram(stat= "identity", fill= ChickWeight$Diet)
```

3. In your opinion, which graph gives you more information and why? (1)
#I think the box plot give you more information because of all the data it gives you (media, 25%tile, 75%tile, outliers, etc) but a histogram is visually more intuitive.  
4. Calculate the mean, median, range, and interquartile range for diet 1 (4)
```{r}
 mchick<- tapply(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight$Diet, mean)
 print(mchick)
 #diet1 mean: 102.645#

medianchick<- tapply(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight$Diet, median) print(medianchick)
#diet1 median: 88 

rchick<- tapply(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight$Diet, range)
print(rchick)
#diet1 range: 305-35= 270

ichick<- tapply(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight$Diet, IQR)
print(ichick)
#diet1 IQR: 78.75
```

Part C) Open the Dietox dataset (3 pts total)
```{r}
library(doBy)
data(Dietox)
```
1a. Briefly summarize what the dietox dataset is about (hint: ?dietox should be helpful) (1)
##diets and detoxes is a group of pigs; it covers things like weight, type of feed, time they start and stop and the litter the pigs come from. 
1b. Create an object that stores the summary of mean weight according to copper dose. (1)
```{r}
cu75<-(dietox$Weight[dietox$Cu=="Cu175"])
summary(cu75)
#62.20
c35<- (dietox$Weight[dietox$Cu=="Cu035"])
summary(c35)
#59.71
c00<- (dietox$Weight[dietox$Cu=="Cu000"])
summary(c00)
#60.29
```
1c. Which copper dose resulted in the mean highest weight gain? (1)
```{r}
#COPPER 175
```
